```{r}
pool <- c(rep('g', 20), rep('r', 5))
draw <- sample(pool, replace = FALSE)

left_data <- data.frame()
for (i in 1:5) {
  for (j in 1:5) {
    left_data <- rbind(left_data, get_person(base = c(i-1, j-1)))
  }
}

```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot(cars)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
